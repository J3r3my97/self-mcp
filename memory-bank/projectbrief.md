# Weather MCP Server Project Brief

## Project Overview
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides weather information tools to AI agents. The server will expose weather-related functionality through a standardized MCP interface, making it easy for AI agents to access and understand weather data.

## Core Requirements
1. Implement MCP server with weather-related tools
2. Deploy to Google Cloud Run
3. Use National Weather Service API for data
4. Provide reliable, real-time weather information
5. Follow MCP standards for AI agent interaction

## Project Goals
- Create a production-ready weather information service
- Enable AI agents to easily access weather data
- Provide accurate, up-to-date weather information
- Ensure high availability through Cloud Run deployment
- Maintain clear documentation and API specifications

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Weather forecast retrieval
- Weather alerts system
- Current conditions reporting
- US-based weather data
- Cloud Run deployment
- MCP-compliant API endpoints

### Out of Scope
- Historical weather data analysis
- Weather prediction modeling
- International weather data
- User authentication
- Data persistence
