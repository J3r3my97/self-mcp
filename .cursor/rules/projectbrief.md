# Gate-Release.io Project Brief

## Project Overview
Build a computer vision system that identifies fashion items from user-uploaded images, breaking the "gatekeeping" culture in fashion where influencers refuse to disclose what they're wearing.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Image Processing
   - Accept user-uploaded images
   - Process images containing fashion items (worn or standalone)
   - Handle various image qualities and backgrounds

2. Fashion Item Detection
   - Detect and isolate individual clothing items
   - Generate bounding boxes around items
   - Handle multiple items in single images

3. Item Classification
   - Classify items by category (shirt, dress, pants, etc.)
   - Extract attributes (color, pattern, material, style)
   - Match against product database

4. Product Matching
   - Find similar products in database
   - Return purchase links
   - Rank results by similarity

5. User Experience
   - Simple image upload interface
   - Clear results display
   - Search history tracking

### Technical Requirements
1. Computer Vision
   - YOLO/Faster R-CNN for object detection
   - Vision Transformer for feature extraction
   - Efficient similarity search

2. Backend
   - FastAPI for API server
   - PostgreSQL for product database
   - Vector database for embeddings

3. Infrastructure
   - Cloud deployment ready
   - Scalable architecture
   - Secure file handling

## Project Goals

### MVP Goals
1. Basic image upload and processing
2. Single-item detection and classification
3. Simple product matching
4. Basic web interface
5. Core API functionality

### Success Metrics
1. Top-5 accuracy (correct item in top 5 results)
2. Category classification accuracy
3. Response time under 2 seconds
4. User satisfaction rating
