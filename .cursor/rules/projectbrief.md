# Gate-Release.io Project Brief

## Project Overview
Build a computer vision system that identifies fashion items from user-uploaded images, breaking the "gatekeeping" culture in fashion where influencers refuse to disclose what they're wearing.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Image Processing
   - Accept user-uploaded images
   - Process images containing fashion items
   - Handle various image qualities and backgrounds

2. Fashion Item Detection
   - Detect items using Faster R-CNN
   - Generate accurate bounding boxes
   - Provide confidence scores

3. Feature Extraction
   - Extract features using Vision Transformer
   - Generate 768-dimensional embeddings
   - Enable similarity matching

4. Product Matching
   - Find similar products using cosine similarity
   - Return ranked results
   - Save search history

5. Firebase Integration
   - Store product information
   - Manage embeddings
   - Handle file storage
   - Track search results

### Technical Requirements
1. Computer Vision
   - Faster R-CNN for object detection
   - Vision Transformer for feature extraction
   - Efficient similarity search

2. Backend
   - FastAPI for API server
   - Firebase Realtime Database
   - Firebase Storage

3. Infrastructure
   - Cloud deployment ready
   - Scalable architecture
   - Secure file handling

## Project Goals

### MVP Goals
