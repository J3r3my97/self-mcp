# Gate-Release.io Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing MVP with core functionality:
1. Basic image upload and processing
2. Single-item detection and classification
3. Simple product matching
4. Core API endpoints

## Recent Changes
1. Set up project structure
2. Created basic FastAPI server
3. Added core dependencies
4. Defined API schemas

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Core Setup (Current)
1. [ ] Set up database models
   - Products table
   - Categories table
   - Attributes table
   - Embeddings table

2. [ ] Implement basic image processing
   - Image validation
   - Preprocessing pipeline
   - Storage handling

3. [ ] Create model interfaces
   - Detector interface
   - Feature extractor interface
   - Similarity search interface

### Phase 2: Model Implementation
1. [ ] Implement YOLO detector
   - Load pre-trained model
   - Add detection pipeline
   - Handle bounding boxes

2. [ ] Set up ViT feature extractor
   - Load pre-trained model
   - Implement feature extraction
   - Add classification heads

3. [ ] Create similarity search
   - Implement vector matching
   - Add ranking logic
   - Create database queries

### Phase 3: API Development
1. [ ] Complete API endpoints
   - Image upload endpoint
   - Processing endpoint
   - Results endpoint

2. [ ] Add error handling
   - Input validation
   - Processing errors
   - Database errors

3. [ ] Implement testing
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - API tests

## Active Decisions

### Model Selection
- Using YOLOv8 for detection
- Using ViT-B/16 for features
- Starting with pre-trained models
- Will fine-tune later

### Database Design
- PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Separate tables for products/embeddings
- Efficient indexing strategy
- Simple schema for MVP

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Async processing
- Clear error responses
- Versioned API

## Current Considerations

### Performance
- Need to optimize image processing
- Consider batch processing
- Plan for concurrent requests
- Monitor response times

### Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Plan for database sharding
- Consider caching strategy
- Prepare for load balancing

### Testing
- Need comprehensive test suite
- Include performance tests
- Add monitoring
- Plan for A/B testing

## Immediate Tasks
1. Set up database models
2. Implement basic image processing
3. Create model interfaces
4. Add basic error handling

## Known Issues
1. Need to handle large images
2. Consider memory usage
3. Plan for model loading time
4. Handle concurrent requests
