# Gate-Release.io Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing MVP with core functionality:
1. Basic image upload and processing
2. Single-item detection and classification
3. Simple product matching
4. Core API endpoints

## Recent Changes
1. Implemented FashionDetector class with Faster R-CNN and ViT
2. Created SimilaritySearch class for product matching
3. Implemented ImageProcessor service

## Active Decisions

### Model Selection
- Using Faster R-CNN for detection
- Using ViT-B/16 for features
- Starting with pre-trained models
- Will fine-tune later

### Database Design
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Firebase Storage for files
- Custom indexing for search
- Efficient data structure

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints
- Async processing
- Clear error responses
- Versioned API

## Current Considerations

### Performance
- Need to optimize image processing
- Consider batch processing
- Plan for concurrent requests
- Monitor response times

### Scalability
- Firebase auto-scaling
- Efficient data structure
- Consider caching strategy
- Optimize queries

### Testing

- Need to add performance tests
- Add monitoring
- Plan for A/B testing

## Immediate Tasks
1. Implement API endpoints
2. Add error handling
3. Set up monitoring
4. Add performance tests

## Known Issues
1. Need to handle large images
2. Consider memory usage
3. Plan for model loading time
4. Handle concurrent requests
