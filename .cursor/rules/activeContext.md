# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing core API endpoints for fashion item detection and search
- Setting up Firebase integration for data storage and retrieval
- Configuring middleware for security and performance

## Recent Changes
1. API Structure
   - Implemented core endpoints for image processing and search
   - Added proper error handling and response models
   - Set up rate limiting for API endpoints

2. Firebase Integration
   - Added Firebase initialization with service account authentication
   - Implemented repository pattern for Firebase operations
   - Added health check methods for Firebase services

3. Middleware Configuration
   - Added GZip compression for API responses
   - Configured CORS with proper origin settings
   - Added TrustedHost middleware for security
   - Set up HTTPS redirect (optional)

4. Configuration Management
   - Implemented centralized settings using Pydantic
   - Added environment variable support
   - Created proper validation for settings

## Next Steps
1. API Development
   - Implement image upload endpoint
   - Add search result caching
   - Implement batch processing for multiple items

2. Firebase Integration
   - Add data validation before storage
   - Implement proper error handling for Firebase operations
   - Add retry mechanisms for failed operations

3. Testing
   - Add unit tests for API endpoints
   - Implement integration tests for Firebase operations
   - Add performance testing for image processing

## Active Decisions
1. API Design
   - Using FastAPI for modern async support
   - RESTful endpoints with proper versioning
   - JSON responses with consistent error format

2. Database
   - Firebase Realtime Database for product data
   - Firebase Storage for image embeddings
   - Using repository pattern for data access

3. Security
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - CORS configuration for controlled access
   - HTTPS enforcement for production

## Current Considerations
1. Performance
   - Image processing optimization
   - Database query efficiency
   - Response compression

2. Scalability
   - Firebase usage limits
   - Storage optimization
   - Caching strategies

3. Testing
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Integration test setup
   - Performance benchmarks

## Immediate Tasks
1. Complete API endpoints
   - Implement image upload validation
   - Add search result pagination
   - Implement proper error responses

2. Firebase Operations
   - Add data validation
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add retry mechanisms

3. Testing Setup
   - Configure test environment
   - Add basic test cases
   - Set up CI pipeline

## Known Issues
1. Firebase initialization needs proper error handling
2. Rate limiting needs persistence for distributed systems
3. Image processing needs optimization for large files
4. Need to implement proper logging throughout the application
