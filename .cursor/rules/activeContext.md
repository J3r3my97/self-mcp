# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Successfully deployed MVP to Google Cloud Run
- Optimizing container configuration and port settings
- Ensuring stable Firebase integration
- Monitoring application health and performance

## Recent Changes
- Fixed Firebase service account configuration
- Updated container port configuration to 8080 for Cloud Run compatibility
- Resolved model caching and HuggingFace integration
- Successfully deployed application to Cloud Run
- Implemented proper error handling for service account parsing
- Optimized Docker configuration for production deployment

## Next Steps
1. Core Setup (Completed)
   - [x] Project structure and dependencies
   - [x] Basic configuration
   - [x] Docker setup
   - [x] CI/CD pipeline

2. Model Implementation (Completed)
   - [x] FashionDetector implementation
   - [x] SimilaritySearch implementation
   - [x] ImageProcessor service
   - [x] Test suite
   - [x] Model optimization

3. API Development (Next)
   - [x] Basic endpoints
   - [x] Error handling
   - [x] Rate limiting
   - [ ] Authentication
   - [ ] Documentation

## Active Decisions
1. Model Selection
   - Using Faster R-CNN for detection
   - Using ViT-B/16 for feature extraction
   - Confidence threshold set to 0.5
   - Model caching in /app/models directory

2. Database Design
   - Firebase Realtime Database for product storage
   - Firebase Storage for image hosting
   - Vector similarity search for product matching
   - Service account authentication via environment variables

3. API Design
   - RESTful endpoints
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Health check endpoints
   - Error handling with detailed responses
   - Port 8080 for Cloud Run compatibility

## Current Considerations
1. Performance
   - Model loading time optimization
   - Response time optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Container resource utilization

2. Scalability
   - Horizontal scaling with Cloud Run
   - Database sharding strategy
   - Load balancing considerations
   - Container startup time optimization

3. Testing
   - Unit test coverage
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing
   - Deployment testing

## Immediate Tasks
1. Implement authentication
2. Add comprehensive API documentation
3. Set up monitoring and logging
4. Optimize container startup time
5. Implement health check improvements

## Known Issues
1. Container startup time needs optimization
2. Memory usage during inference
3. Rate limiting implementation needs testing
4. Error handling for edge cases
5. Firebase connection stability

## Deployment Status
- Local development environment configured
- Docker setup complete
- Cloud Run deployment successful
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Monitoring and logging to be implemented
