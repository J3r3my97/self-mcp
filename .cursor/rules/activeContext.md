# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core functionalities
- Setting up deployment pipeline for Google Cloud Run
- Configuring Docker and environment setup for local development

## Recent Changes
- Implemented FashionDetector class with Faster R-CNN and ViT
- Created SimilaritySearch class for product matching
- Implemented ImageProcessor service for end-to-end processing
- Added comprehensive test suite
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Set up Docker configuration with model caching
- Implemented API endpoints with rate limiting and security
- Added health check endpoints
- Created deployment configuration for Google Cloud Run

## Next Steps
1. Core Setup (In Progress)
   - [x] Project structure and dependencies
   - [x] Basic configuration
   - [x] Docker setup
   - [ ] CI/CD pipeline

2. Model Implementation (Current)
   - [x] FashionDetector implementation
   - [x] SimilaritySearch implementation
   - [x] ImageProcessor service
   - [x] Test suite
   - [ ] Model optimization

3. API Development (Next)
   - [x] Basic endpoints
   - [x] Error handling
   - [x] Rate limiting
   - [ ] Authentication
   - [ ] Documentation

## Active Decisions
1. Model Selection
   - Using Faster R-CNN for detection
   - Using ViT-B/16 for feature extraction
   - Confidence threshold set to 0.5

2. Database Design
   - Firebase Realtime Database for product storage
   - Firebase Storage for image hosting
   - Vector similarity search for product matching

3. API Design
   - RESTful endpoints
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Health check endpoints
   - Error handling with detailed responses

## Current Considerations
1. Performance
   - Model loading time optimization
   - Response time optimization
   - Caching strategies

2. Scalability
   - Horizontal scaling with Cloud Run
   - Database sharding strategy
   - Load balancing considerations

3. Testing
   - Unit test coverage
   - Integration testing
   - Performance testing

## Immediate Tasks
1. Complete CI/CD pipeline setup
2. Implement authentication
3. Add comprehensive API documentation
4. Optimize model performance
5. Set up monitoring and logging

## Known Issues
1. Model loading time needs optimization
2. Memory usage during inference
3. Rate limiting implementation needs testing
4. Error handling for edge cases
5. Firebase connection stability

## Deployment Status
- Local development environment configured
- Docker setup complete
- Cloud Run deployment configuration ready
- CI/CD pipeline in progress
- Monitoring and logging to be implemented
