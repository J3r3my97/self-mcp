# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Successfully implemented authentication system
- Integrated Google Cloud Secret Manager for secure key storage
- Set up Postman integration with OAuth2 authentication
- Optimizing API documentation and testing

## Recent Changes
- Implemented JWT-based authentication
- Added user registration and login endpoints
- Integrated Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Updated API documentation with authentication details
- Fixed Swagger UI OAuth2 configuration
- Added Postman integration instructions

## Next Steps
1. Core Setup (Completed)
   - [x] Project structure and dependencies
   - [x] Basic configuration
   - [x] Docker setup
   - [x] CI/CD pipeline

2. Model Implementation (Completed)
   - [x] FashionDetector implementation
   - [x] SimilaritySearch implementation
   - [x] ImageProcessor service
   - [x] Test suite
   - [x] Model optimization

3. API Development (Completed)
   - [x] Basic endpoints
   - [x] Error handling
   - [x] Rate limiting
   - [x] Authentication
   - [x] Documentation

4. Testing and Integration (Next)
   - [ ] Postman collection testing
   - [ ] API endpoint validation
   - [ ] Authentication flow testing
   - [ ] Performance testing
   - [ ] Security testing

## Active Decisions
1. Authentication
   - Using JWT tokens with 30-minute expiration
   - OAuth2 password flow for API access
   - Google Cloud Secret Manager for key storage
   - Secure token handling and validation

2. API Security
   - Rate limiting (60 requests/minute)
   - HTTPS redirection in production
   - Secure secret management
   - Token-based authentication

3. Documentation
   - OpenAPI/Swagger integration
   - Postman collection support
   - Authentication flow documentation
   - API usage examples

## Current Considerations
1. Security
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Rate limiting optimization
   - Secret rotation strategy
   - API key management

2. Testing
   - Authentication flow testing
   - API endpoint validation
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing

3. Documentation
   - API usage examples
   - Authentication guide
   - Postman collection
   - Error handling guide

## Immediate Tasks
1. Complete Postman collection testing
2. Validate authentication flows
3. Document API usage examples
4. Implement token refresh mechanism
5. Set up monitoring and logging

## Known Issues
1. Token refresh mechanism needed
2. Rate limiting needs optimization
3. API documentation needs examples
4. Postman collection needs validation
5. Security testing pending

## Deployment Status
- Local development environment configured
- Authentication system implemented
- API documentation updated
- Postman integration ready
- Security measures in place
